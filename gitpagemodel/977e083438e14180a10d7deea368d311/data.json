        "content": "Information on HIV and on services and education to learn how to prevent or\r\nreduce the risk of infection is increasingly available in almost every\r\ncountry. Information can be found at health centres, fixed and mobile HIV care\r\nunits, testing and counselling centres, youth centres and in many schools.\r\nInformation is also available through the internet and other media. **HIV\r\ntesting and counselling can help in early detection of infection. It can\r\nenable those who are infected to:** * get the support services they need *\r\nmanage other infections they might have * learn about living with HIV * learn\r\nhow to avoid infecting others. Anyone who thinks that he or she might be\r\ninfected with HIV should contact a health-care provider or an AIDS centre to\r\nreceive confidential testing and counselling. Anyone who lives in an area\r\nwhere HIV is prevalent and has had unprotected sex should be encouraged to be\r\ntested and counselled. Voluntary HIV testing and counselling can help people\r\nmake informed choices about their health and their sexual behaviour. It can\r\nhelp couples decide whether or not to have children. If one partner has HIV\r\nthere is a risk the other partner can become infected while trying to\r\nconceive. If a couple is expecting a baby, testing and counselling can help\r\nthem make decisions regarding the health of their baby. Counselling and\r\ntesting can also help those not infected to remain uninfected through\r\neducation about ways to avoid risk, including safer sex choices. There are\r\nmany types of HIV tests. It is important to talk to a professional to learn\r\nabout the type of test being used and its accuracy. If the result of an HIV\r\ntest is negative, this means the person tested is not infected or it is too\r\nearly to detect the virus. In adults, the HIV blood test may not detect\r\ninfection for up to six weeks after exposure. Depending on the test, detection\r\nin babies may take up to 18 months after birth. However, early infant\r\ndiagnosis (EID) can be conducted as early as six weeks. Families and\r\ncommunities should insist on and support confidential HIV testing, counselling\r\nand information. Confidentiality helps protect children, adolescents and\r\nadults from experiencing stigma, discrimination, exclusion and isolation.\r\nCounselling can help to empower women and adolescent girls, promote safer sex\r\nand condom use, and help detect and facilitate treatment of sexually\r\ntransmitted infections - all of which can reduce the chances of HIV infection.\r\nIf a woman or adolescent girl is diagnosed with HIV and has children or is\r\npregnant, assistance may be required to help her protect, care for and support\r\nher children. Community support groups and NGOs often provide assistance.\r\nIncreasing access to testing followed by treatment, care and support can help\r\nto reduce stigma by demonstrating that HIV is not a 'death sentence' and that\r\nmany people infected with HIV can lead relatively healthy, happy and\r\nproductive lives.\r\n\r\n",
